  <p><strong>Reducing response time for emergency vehicles</strong></p>
</div>

---

### 🚨 Overview
RapidMedX aims to minimize emergency response delays caused by traffic congestion and outdated dispatch systems. Our solution integrates real-time tracking, automated navigation, and smart traffic control to streamline ambulance operations.

### ⚡ Problem Statement
Ambulances often face delays due to dense traffic and inefficient routing.

Existing ambulance booking systems lack live tracking, automation, and dynamic route optimization—putting critical seconds at risk.

### 🧠 Project Highlights
- **Real-time GPS tracking** of ambulances.
- **Automated navigation** that recalculates routes based on live traffic.
- **Smart traffic signal priority** to clear paths for responding vehicles.
- **IoT integration** for traffic system control.
- **Backend dispatch algorithms** to assign resources efficiently.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS
- **Backend:** Java
- **Embedded Systems:** C++
- **IoT:** Hardware modules for traffic control and sensors
